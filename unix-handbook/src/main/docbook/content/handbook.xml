    <title>Preface</title>

    <para>This handbook is the complete documentation of the Unix Maven
    Plugin. It has four major parts:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Part I - Guide: An introduction and overview over the plugin.
        This part is the first you should read if you're looking into using
        the plugin or is getting started. </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Part II - Examples: This part is contains a set of practical
        examples showing different aspects of the plugin.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Part III - Reference: This is the reference manual for the
        plugin. Documents all available options and assembly
        operations.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Part IV - Version History and Upgrading: This part contains a
        list of all major features added in the different versions and
        explanations on how to upgrade between the different versions.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The book is under continous development and is written in parallel
    with the plugin. It will only document the current version until a stable
    release is done. See <xref linkend="version-history-and-upgrading" /> on
    how to upgrade from one version to the next version.</para>

    <para>Currently there are chapters and sections that serve as placeholders
    and there are warnings which serve as TODO entries. These will be filled
    in and resolved before a final 1.0 release.</para>

        <title>About the plugin</title>

        <para>The Unix Maven Plugin is meant to fill in the gap between
        creating platform independent applications and reality. It make it
        possible to create Java application with your standard Java
        development stack, but still be able to install the applications using
        the native tools that your system administrators already know.</para>

        <para>As it automates yet another step in the development
        chain<footnote>
            <para>Development chain here refers to all the step that's between
            writing the code in an IDE to having it run in production or a
            production-like environment.</para>
          </footnote>, it also give a new set of possibilities that can be
        taken advantage of. In particular the ability to store production
        ready binaries in a repository and the ability to install, remove and
        upgrade the software in an uniform and consistent way across an entire
        company.</para>

        <para>Both of these abilities is similar to what Maven did for Java
        developers with the repository concept with Maven 1 and the high focus
        on build unification in Maven 2.</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="how-the-plugin-work">
        <title>How the Plugin Work</title>

        <para>This section is a high level explanation of how the plugin
        work.</para>

        <para>The plugin goes through two major phases:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Meta data generation: Each package format contain some form
            of meta data that it uses when the package is being installed or
            removed. The plugin will pick up as much meta data as possible
            from the Maven POM as possible, but there are certain options that
            might have to be filled in, depending on the package
            format.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Assembly operation execution: For each package that is to be
            created, a virtual package file system is created with pointers to
            the original file or which file in and archive the file came from.
            The assembled file system will be used when the physical package
            is created.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <section>
          <title>Meta Data Generation</title>

          <para>The first thing that happens is that the plugin starts to
          gather all the information it needs to build the package. It has
          main sources it uses:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>The general information in the POM</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The <tag>&lt;configuration&gt;</tag> of the plugin is used
              to set up defaults and contain, amongst other settings, a shared
              list of assembly operations</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>The per-package configuration <tag>&lt;package&gt;</tag>
              entry</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        </section>

        <section>
          <title>Assembly Operation Execution</title>

          <para>The virtual package file system is just like a normal file
          system. Files can be added, and their attributes can be modified by
          any operation. As in a normal file system, if the a file is written
          to the file system twice, the last one will overwrite the first
          one.</para>

          <para>As the file system is just a virtual file system with pointers
          to the original file or files in an archive only the last file will
          actually be used when creating the physical package.</para>

          <para>When an existing file object is used as a source, as much as
          possible of the existing attributes will be copied from the
          object.</para>

          <para>After all the assembly operations has been executed, the
          physical package file will be created.</para>

          <para>See also <xref
          linkend="concept-package-file-system" />.</para>

      <section>
        <title>About the Alternatives to the Unix Maven Plugin</title>

        <note>
          <para>This information is current as of May 2009.</para>
        </note>

        <para>The Unix Maven Plugin contains functionality that is similar to
        at least four existing plugins: The Deb Maven plugin, the RPM Maven
        Plugin, the Solaris Maven plugin and the Maven Assembly plugin.</para>

        <para>The Unix plugin is loosely based on the source code of the Deb,
        Solaris and Rpm Maven plugins and was meant as a unified and complete
        replacement for all three plugins. The plugins supported different
        areas of functionality and the Unix plugin has implemented all
        features for all formats where applicable. The Unix plugin is already
        more complete and easier to use than the Deb and Solaris plugins. The
        RPM plugin still has features that the Unix plugin does not support
        yet.</para>

        <para>One major feature of the Unix Maven plugin is the support for
        assembling the files to be included into the package, including file
        attributes. The Assembly plugin is cumbersome to use and gives little
        to no control over the file attributes that are requested. If the Unix
        plugin was to require a pre-assembled file system before executing the
        process would be significantly slower as all the files would have to
        be written to disk in an intermediate area. The Unix Maven plugin
        optimizes this as much as possible and will in many cases read the
        files directly from inside the Maven repository or from archives in a
        repository. This gives significant speed improvements when large
        binaries are created.</para>

      <title>Concepts</title>

      <section>
        <title>Operation Modes</title>

        <para>The plugin can operate in two major modes, depending on how it
        is configured:</para>

        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>Primary artifact mode</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>The plugin is running in primary mode when the project has
              set a &lt;packaging&gt; to one of the packaging that the plugin
              support. The plugin will install an artifact as the primary
              artifact into the repository</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>Attached artifact mode</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>The plugin is running in attached mode when the project is
              executing the one of the package-FOO-attached goals. The plugin
              will install a package in addition to the primary artifact which
              will be delivered by another plugin.</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Package Formats</title>

        <para>A package format is a specific file format that a platform
        supports. The plugin currently support three formats; deb, pkg and
        rpm.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Platform</title>

        <para>A platform is a specific operating system, for example Debian or
        Solaris. Each platform has its own native package format while some
        platforms support multiple formats.</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="concept-package-file-system">
        <title>Package File System and File System Objects</title>

        <para>A package file system is a virtual file system created while the
        plugin executes all the assembly operations. It consist of file
        objects that represent regular files, directories and symbolic
        links.</para>

        <para>Each file system object has a set of attributes similar to a
        normal Unix file system:</para>

        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>User and group</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>These two attributes control the user and group that own
              the file.</para>

          </varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>

          <varlistentry>
            <term>Tags</term>

            <listitem>
              <para>Each file object can have a set of tags which are plain
              text labels that each package format can use as an extension
              method.</para>

      <title>Action Scripts</title>

      <para>All the native packaging formats support running programs when the
      packages are installed and removed. The plugin has automatic support for
      picking up scripts from the source folders.</para>

      <para>The plugin will automatically pick up scripts from the
      <filename>src/main/unix/scripts</filename> directory. If a build is
      generating more than one artifact, it is possible to share common parts
      of the script between the packages based on the package id. The plugin
      uses two different strategies for naming the scripts based on the
      operation mode as described below.</para>

        <para>The plugin has its own mechanism to be more verbose to make it
        easier to just debug the plugin. By running Maven with the
        <command>-Dmaven.unix.debug=true</command> flag you will get a lot of
        extra debugging information. In particular you will get information
        about all the assembly operations it has collected per package and all
        output from any external command it will use while building the
        package.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Upgrading from 1.0-alpha-3</title>

        <para>The <tag>&lt;softwareGroup&gt;</tag> element within the RPM
        configuration tag (<tag>&lt;rpm&gt;</tag>) has been renamed to
        <tag>&lt;group&gt;</tag> to match the field in the RPM spec file more
        closely.</para>

        <para>The tag <tag>&lt;id&gt;</tag> has been renamed to
        <tag>&lt;classifier&gt;</tag> to be closer to the existing Maven
        nomenclature.</para>

        <para>All examples use hyphened elements instead of camel casing to be
        more consistent with how Maven POMs normally are written. This will
        not break any builds as Maven interpret both version the same way. For
        example <tag>&lt;fileAttributes&gt;</tag> is now used instead of
        <tag>&lt;file-attribues&gt;</tag>.</para>
